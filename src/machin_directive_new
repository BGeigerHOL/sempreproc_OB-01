1. The manufacturer of a machinery product or his or her authorised representative shall ensure that a risk assessment is carried out in order to determine the health and safety requirements, which apply to the machinery product. The machinery product shall then be designed and constructed to prevent and minimise all relevant risks, taking into account the results of the risk assessment.
By the iterative process of risk assessment and risk reduction referred to in the first subparagraph, the manufacturer or his or her authorised representative shall: 
(a) determine the limits of the machinery product, which include the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof;
(b) determine the risks resulting from interactions between machinery in order to achieve the same end that are arranged and controlled so that they function as an integral whole, thus forming a machinery product as defined in Article 3, point (1), point (d); 
(c) identify the hazards that may be generated by the machinery product and the associated hazardous situations, including hazards that may be generated during the lifecycle of the machinery product that are foreseeable at the time of placing of the machinery product on the market as an intended evolution of its fully or partially evolving behaviour or logic as a result of the machinery product designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy. In this respect, where the machinery product integrates an artificial intelligence system, the machinery risk assessment shall consider the risk assessment for that artificial intelligence system that has been carried out pursuant to the Regulation â€¦ of the European Parliament and of the Council+ on a European approach for Artificial Intelligence+1;.
(d) estimate the risks, taking into account the severity of the possible injury or damage to health and the probability of its occurrence;
(e) evaluate the risks, with a view to determining whether risk reduction is required, in accordance with the objective of this Regulation;
(f) eliminate the hazards or reduce the risks associated with these hazards by application of protective measures, in the order of priority established in section 1.1.2(b).
