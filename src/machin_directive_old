1. The manufacturer of machinery or his authorised representative must ensure that a risk assessment is carried out in order to determine the health and safety requirements which apply to the machinery. The machinery must then be designed and constructed taking into account the results of the risk assessment.
By the iterative process of risk assessment and risk reduction referred to above, the manufacturer or his authorised representative shall:
— determine the limits of the machinery, which include the intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof,
— identify the hazards that can be generated by the machinery and the associated hazardous situations,
— estimate the risks, taking into account the severity of the possible injury or damage to health and the probability of its occurrence,
— evaluate the risks, with a view to determining whether risk reduction is required, in accordance with the objective of this Directive,
— eliminate the hazards or reduce the risks associated with these hazards by application of protective measures, in the order of priority established in section 1.1.2(b).
