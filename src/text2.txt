Four identical tyres shall be fitted on the test vehicle. In the case of C3 tyres with a load capacity index in excess of 121 and without any dual fitting indication, two of these tyres of the same type and range shall be fitted to the rear axle of the test vehicle; the front axle shall be fitted with tyres of size suitable for the axle load and planed down to the minimum depth in order to minimize the influence of tyre/road contact noise while maintaining a sufficient level of safety.
In the case of C2 tyres with a load capacity index lower or equal to 121, with a section width wider than 200 mm, an aspect ratio lower than 55, a rim diameter code lower than 15 and without any dual fitting indication, two of these tyres of the same type and range shall be fitted to the rear axle of the test vehicle; the front axle shall be fitted with tyres of a size suitable for the axle load and planed down to the minimum depth in order to minimize the influence of tyre/road contact noise while maintaining a sufficient level of safety.
Tyres with special fitting requirements shall be tested in accordance with these requirements (e.g. rotation direction). The tyres shall have full tread depth before being run-in.
Tyres are to be tested on rims permitted by the tyre manufacturer.
