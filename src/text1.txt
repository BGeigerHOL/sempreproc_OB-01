Four identical tyres shall be fitted on the test vehicle. In the case of tyres with a load capacity index in excess of 121 and without any dual fitting indication, two of these tyres of the same type and range shall be fitted to the rear axle of the test vehicle; the front axle shall be fitted with tyres of size suitable for the axle load and planed down to the minimum depth in order to minimize the influence of tyre/road contact noise while maintaining a sufficient level of safety. Winter tyres that in certain Contracting Parties may be equipped with studs intended to enhance friction shall be tested without this equipment. Tyres with special fitting requirements shall be tested in accordance with these requirements (e.g. rotation direction). The tyres shall have full tread depth before being run-in.
Tyres are to be tested on rims permitted by the tyre manufacturer.
